\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We identified a novel intervention to diversify (according to user-input constraints) the output of top-$k$ queries by refining the selection predicates of the input query. Furthermore, we recognized the importance of maintaining the user's intent as best as possible when searching for such a refinement. Towards this end, we developed a framework that can find the closest refinement for various distance measures that satisfy the user's desired constraints. 
We introduced optimizations in order to make our framework practical for datasets of real-life scale. We demonstrated this with a suite of experiments, showing our framework's scaling capability and the usefulness of our optimizations. In the future, this problem could be extended to find refinements that remain diverse even after adding new data. This way, the refinement may explain some underlying bias of the query instead of fitting to the original data. Extending our model to richer classes of queries presents further interesting directions as we discussed in \Cref{sec:search}.
